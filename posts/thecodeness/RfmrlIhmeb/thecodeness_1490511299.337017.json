I haven't been THAT stumped about a few lines of code since probably year 1, semester 1, day 1 of university a.k.a my first day of coding \ud83d\ude02. I came home after fixing the bug with overhead-light-scorched, dry, crazy eyes (probably because I didn't blink in the 2 hours I spent debugging) and a raging migraine. You know the feel? But the relief I got when I fixed it is like nothing else that can be experienced in the physical world (codegasm, you heard it here first folks) \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udea8\ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udcad, 240317."
