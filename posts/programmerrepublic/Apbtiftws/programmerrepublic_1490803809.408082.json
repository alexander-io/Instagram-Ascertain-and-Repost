So many people try to present programming as this mind straining process of typing unrecognizable syntax. Disregarding the beginners, because it is extremely tough in the start. But in reality, for the people doing this for years, it's not that intense. You solve problems. You don't need to be a math genius, you don't need to be academically inclined, you just need motivation and patience. If anyone ever makes it seem like programming is extremely difficult, ignore them. The code itself is not the hard part, it's staying motivated and pushing yourself to learn that is. Also, a lot of people are surprised when they hear I've only done this for 6-8 months now, but that's really how long it takes to get moving. Investing in that tiny chunk of time can be the most valuable thing you can do for yourself. One person I strongly admire for doing this is @justinwarger. He's in a position he isn't content with and he's acting on it. That's all it takes. Code on! #worldcode"
