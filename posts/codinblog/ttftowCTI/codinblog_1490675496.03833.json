Though, I must say that it's really interesting how you can connect to devices with UUID's and just scan every BLE device in your area, really fascinating. I'm also going to another meeting with the company that I might be developing an app for, which is crazy due to the fact that I started with iOS development in February! Super stoked!! Anyways, stay fresh and keep coding!\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#macbook #macbookpro #programmerrepublic #programming #love #me #iwritethingswithcode #fun #share #softwareengineering #ios #iosdevelopment #apple #engineer #appdevelopment #swift #coffe #hustle #app #stockholm #worldcode"
