	"description" : "Crucible / Marbled Grey\n\nMost of the smaller pieces in this batch were made following a new approach. I set out a selection of bags of clay on the workbench; some already blended, some recycled and some straight out of the packet. I set some rules: natural tones only, and each resulting blend should contain 50% white clay, leaving the remaining half to be decided in the moment, 10% this stoneware, 10% a grey blend, 20% recycled random blend and so on. And then I could decide how to mix them, in what order to incorporate them, and how thoroughly to blend them. With this piece I wedged together most of the constituent clays but left the black until the very end, leaving a distinct stripe spiralling up through the piece. \nBlending clay is an interesting way to work. All of the aesthetic decisions are made in the very first moment, and in the case of the marbled pieces much is left to the motion of the wheel and the mechanics of throwing. Alternatively, work that is decorated by glaze exists as a blank until the glazing stage, unless some aspect of the thrown form suggests a certain treatment, and so a different kind of freedom is enjoyed by separating the stages of forming and decoration. \nThis marbled piece is available in the shop, link in bio.\n\n#material #ceramic #ceramics #design #keramik #ceramica #ceramicist #colour #geometry #geology #maker #pottery #bowls"
