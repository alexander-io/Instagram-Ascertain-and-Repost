	"description" : "Ceramic Art London, (@ceramicartlondon), is only a few days away\u2014we\u2019re all packed up ready to drive the short distance to Central Saint Martins for the three day show, starting this Friday, through to Sunday. I\u2019ll be my third and last year helping Lisa Hammond, (@lisahammondpottery), set up the show and help throughout the long weekend. The past two shows have been exceptional, meeting many of my followers and other potters too, alongside seeing the breadth of whats capable with clay, the variety and styles of work on show is quite staggering.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not showing my own work, many of the pots I make for the functional soda ware Maze Hill Pottery functional range will be there. It\u2019s a strange feeling someone soon will replace me as the apprentice here, and will be the one in charge of making all the espresso cups, mugs, creamers and other pieces I\u2019ve become so used to creating. It will go to something I threw week in week out to one I might never revisit again\u2014sentimental I know, but it\u2019s been such a large part of my life and the pots have been engrained into my muscle memory and I\u2019ve written about them excessively too.\n\nThese espresso cups, hakeme brushed, are some of the newer pots we\u2019ll have on show. \nIn comparison to how we used to glaze them, with a simple clean layer of slip, the new hakeme brushwork makes the older ones seem almost drab and dull. An additional bonus of the hakeme, is that even the pots that fire without much soda affecting them fire well in most cases. Dry tan and blue pots are still interesting\u2014so it might mean less seconds in the long run. They\u2019re only a little more time consuming to do, the brushing on of slip takes perhaps thirty-seconds to a minute a piece, as opposed to a brief few seconds when they are simply dipped."
