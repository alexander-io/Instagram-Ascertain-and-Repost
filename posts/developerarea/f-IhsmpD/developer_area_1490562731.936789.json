	"description" : "@Regrann from @ivan.webdev -  I've had so many people DM me asking mostly the same questions and it's very difficult to reply to every single person. What I'm going to do is answer all the questions here and if someone asks me again I'll just send them this post. \nWhen did I start/and how long have I been doing this? I started when I was 17 (almost 18) I'm still 18 right now (19 in 2 months) and I have been doing this for about a year now. All those months I was just learning none stop and I wasn't looking for work or anything. About two months ago I started applying to jobs (on freelancing sites). How did I start? Googling and watching a lot of YouTube videos about coding, web development in particular. After I knew what I needed to learn and what steps to take I went on sites like codeacedemy, finished course on html/css and right after I started building small sites with just html/css. At first I had to follow youtube tutorials but later I got the hang of it and I started making basic websites from scratch without youtube tutorials but a lot of googling and stackoverflow for any problem I ran into. After I felt like I was good enough with html/css I started learning JavaScript, I followed the same learning steps I did with html/css.\n\nBest advice I can give is to stick to it and don't give up. If other people did it, so can you! Oh yeah I forgot one thing... you should be googling like crazy! \n#Code #html #css #javascript #webdev #ProgrammerRepublic #webdevelopment #coding #programmer #programming #web #website #webdesign #worldcode #buildtheweb #developer #tech #codingblog #php - #regrann"
