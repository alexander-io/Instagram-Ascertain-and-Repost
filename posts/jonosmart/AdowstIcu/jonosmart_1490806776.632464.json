I will certainly be making some glazed work this time around as well. \nAny suggestions for what you'd like to see? \n#jonosmart is a #potter based in #glasgow. Apparently on days off he can't think of anything good to write down here. #Disappointing. #Wasteofyourtimeandmine. #Dontreadthishashtag. #Gotyou!"
