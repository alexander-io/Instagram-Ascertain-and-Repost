	"description" : "Scotland is a crazy place. \nThis is my first spring living here. Today it hit 15 degrees centigrade and the city centre park has at least a couple of thousand people basking in what is basically cold weather. Scottish people are so incredibly grateful of anything even resembling sunshine. I'm amazed and inside. \n#jonosmart is a #potter who may be based in #scotland but he'll never truly understand these people. Anyway as they say up here: taps aff!"
