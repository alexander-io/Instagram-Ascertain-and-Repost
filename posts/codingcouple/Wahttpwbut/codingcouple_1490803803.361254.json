We enjoy starting our days early, and getting cracking shortly after some good exercise and breakfast. This routine we\u2019ve built over last couple of years boosts our productivity and creativity, and frankly - sometimes after 4-5pm we cannot even think logically anymore. \nIt works perfectly for us - we can still enjoy our afternoons effectively, and spend some valuable time with family, friends, or each other and progress new skills in things different than web development. Obviously there are deadlines and weeks when we have to be in front of the computer 15 hours a day, but we\u2019re doing our best to keep the balance as our priority. Good way to have more hobbies than just coding! \nWe\u2019d like to pay respect to all of the night coding Batmen. We have no idea how you amazing people can crack problems at 3am. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude05 #codingcouple #earlybirds #productivity"
