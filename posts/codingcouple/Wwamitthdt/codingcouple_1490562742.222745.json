It is certainly a good feeling to be super confident about every small bit of the code and not to be going mad about the \u201czombie mistakes\u201d. Although there is still a long way to go, we feel very excited about drilling down deeper into the TDD/BDD concepts.\u26cf\u26a1\ufe0f #codingcouple #tdd #softwaredevelopment"
