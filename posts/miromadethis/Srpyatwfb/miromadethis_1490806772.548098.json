	"description" : "Springtime rituals\u2014thinning peaches. \nEach year, as temperatures warm, fragrant blossoms shed, and fruit begins forming, we visit each tree in our small orchard, and carefully remove a portion of the growing fruit. It always seems a little sad to winnow out so much potential deliciousness (fresh peaches! plums! apricots!) but this allows the trees to concentrate their energy into the remaining fruit. And they say that you don't actually lose produce\u2014the weight of the total harvest remains the same, it's just distributed into a harvest of fruits that are smaller in quantity but larger in specimen. And there is just something so nice about these annual rituals\u2014visiting the same trees, checking their yearly growth, feeling the warmth of the sun, hearing the chickens clucking at your feet (because they are always interested in helping!) and anticipating the taste of the first peaches of the season, warm and fragrant, with all of their sweet-tart sticky juices dribbling down your chin at the first bite."
