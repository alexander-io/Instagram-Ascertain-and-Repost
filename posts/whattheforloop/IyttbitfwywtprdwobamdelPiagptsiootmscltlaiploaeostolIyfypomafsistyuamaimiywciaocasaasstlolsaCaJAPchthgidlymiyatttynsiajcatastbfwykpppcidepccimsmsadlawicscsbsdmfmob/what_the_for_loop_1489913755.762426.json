If you\u2019re trying to break into the field, whether you want to program robots, design websites, or become a more desirable employee, learning Python is a good place to start.\n\nPython is one of the more simple coding languages to learn, as it places less of an emphasis on syntax than other languages. If you forget your parentheses or misplace a few semicolons, it shouldn't trip you up as much as it might if you were coding in another one.\n\nIt can also serve as a stepping stone toward learning other languages, such as C++ and JavaScript. Additionally, Python coders had the highest growth in demand last year, meaning if you are trying to turn your newfound skills into a job, chances are there are spots to be filled with your knowledge. #python #programming #program #coder #iphone #developer #engineer #programmer #computer #computing #iphone #math #stem #mathematics #software #app #design #linux #apple #windows10 #intel #code #school #class #student #billgates #stevejobs #database #macbook ( find more on businessinsider.com )
