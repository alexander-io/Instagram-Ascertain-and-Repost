	"description" : "@Regrann from @ivan.webdev -  I've had so many people DM me asking mostly the same questions and it's very difficult to reply to every single person. What I'm going to do is answer all the questions here and if someone asks me again I'll just send them this post. \nWhen did I start/and how long have I been doing this? I started when I was 17 (almost 18) I'm still 18 right now (19 in 2 months) and I have been doing this for about a year now. All those months I was just learning none stop and I wasn't looking for work or anything. About two months ago I started applying to jobs (on freelancing sites). How did I start? Googling and watching a lot of YouTube videos about coding, web development in particular. After I knew what I needed to learn and what steps to take I went on sites like codeacedemy, finished course on html/css and right after I started building small sites with just html/css. At first I had to follow youtube tutorials but later I got the hang of it and I started making basic websites from scratch without youtube tutorials but a lot of googling and stackoverflow for any problem I ran into. After I felt like I was good enough with html/css I started learning JavaScript, I followed the same learning steps I did with html/css.\n\nBest advice I can give is to stick to it and don't give up. If other people did it, so can you! Oh yeah I forgot one thing... you should be googling like crazy! \n#Code #html #css #javascript #webdev #ProgrammerRepublic #webdevelopment #coding #programmer #programming #web #website #webdesign #worldcode #buildtheweb #developer #tech #codingblog #php - #regrann"

	"description" : "If you\u2019re trying to break into the field, whether you want to program robots, design websites, or become a more desirable employee, learning Python is a good place to start.\n\nPython is one of the more simple coding languages to learn, as it places less of an emphasis on syntax than other languages. If you forget your parentheses or misplace a few semicolons, it shouldn't trip you up as much as it might if you were coding in another one.\n\nIt can also serve as a stepping stone toward learning other languages, such as C++ and JavaScript. Additionally, Python coders had the highest growth in demand last year, meaning if you are trying to turn your newfound skills into a job, chances are there are spots to be filled with your knowledge. #python #programming #program #coder #iphone #developer #engineer #programmer #computer #computing #iphone #math #stem #mathematics #software #app #design #linux #apple #windows10 #intel #code #school #class #student #billgates #stevejobs #database #macbook ( find more on businessinsider.com )"

	"description" : "Now that I have two people on board on this project I\u2019m really feeling like we are making some good progress on the plan. We have a small opportunity with one of the municipalities in Gothenburg, and even though that would be hugely beneficial for the project, our focus is to make the strongest MVP we possibly can. So I spent this morning sketching out different options for the dashboard and doing some brainstorming on the feature set for each level of user authority. One of the team members has been doing a lot of great research on personal information storage and data storage options in Sweden, and we have finally found a great option for us. We\u2019ll be able to go for a simple VPS for our tests and beta version but also upgrade to a dedicated server or rack once we scale up. That is all in the future and will depend on a lot of variables that are way out of scope right now, but we still want to define a very rough path for the project. I\u2019m telling you right now that I will devote 100% of myself to this project. I\u2019ve been wanting to build this for close to 2 years now and the opportunities just keep coming in, so eventually I just said \u201cThere will never be a perfect moment. So I\u2019ll have to create the perfect moment.\u201d and got to work. Right now we\u2019re are on a hunt for at least one person who is experienced in working with similar systems here in Sweden. This is to get feedback and great ideas from their experiences and habits in working with such systems, so that we can create the best system possible for the end user. Now I just got done doing research on taxes and did paperwork and tax work for my company and structured up files, invoices and quotes for storage. Now I\u2019m off to enjoy some time with the wifey. So I wish you all an awesome rest of your weekend and, as always, keep up the hustle! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb"
